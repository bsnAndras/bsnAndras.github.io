# My works

Welcome to my homepage!

I'm currently in the middle of an exciting career transition to become a full-stack web developer. This site marks my first major step toward gaining hands-on experience in a dynamic and promising field—and ultimately, building a more fulfilling career.

Here, you'll find a collection of my projects, primarily from the Greenfox/Codecool full-stack developer course. I’ll be updating this list regularly as I complete new projects that are ready to share.

## Where the journey began:

My first webpage made at the beginning of the full-stack web developer course at Greenfox - Codecool:
